I am a software developer interested in Robotics, Computer Science, CAD
Design, Rocketry, and pretty much anything that has to do with technology. Over
the past few years I have acquired a selfÂ­taught proficiency in a variety of
programming languages and frameworks. Originally specializing in robotics as a
former FIRST Student my skills now include

* mechanical design and CAD 
* server management
* web development 
* database development
* app development 
* Embedded Development (Atmel, Arm, MBed Framework, Arduino Framework, PlatformIO experience, etc.)
* robot development / testing
* Designing, Building and launching High Powered Rockets
* Secret Ninja stuff (fencing, retrieving rockets out of tree's with a bow and arrow, etc.)
